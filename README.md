This is a Simple Bus Reservation System made by using C.

Here, I assumed three stakeholders such as:
  - Customer
  - Executive
  - Admin

Many features has been included into it. For Example:
  - Main Menu (For All Stakeholders)
  - Login (Same for All Stakeholders)
  - Registration (Same for All Stakeholders)
  - Forgotten Password (Same for All Stakeholders)
  - Three Different Menu's for Different Stakeholders.
  - View Bus Schedule.
  - Search Bus System.
